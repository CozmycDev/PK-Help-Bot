This will allow them to use any blood abilities they have permission for.\nNote: All existing waterbenders will need to either rechoose water to get blood OR you can manually add it with `/b add blood <player>`\n- `bending.ability.bloodbending` for the default Bloodbending ability shipped in PK.\nIf you have any addon abilities for the blood subelement, you may also have to add the permission for them, too.\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with the process of adding permissions, you will need a permission plugin like LuckPerms.
