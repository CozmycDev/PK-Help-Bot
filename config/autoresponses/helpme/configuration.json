    "response": "**The Main Config**\nThe main ProjectKorra config can be found at `/plugins/ProjectKorra/config.yml`. Inside this file contains the configuration for most of the plugin. This includes:\n- Enabling and Disabling abilities\n- The damage, range, cooldowns, etc, for each ability\n- The list of blocks that can be used to bend\nAnd way more. We recommend using Ctrl + F to search for what you are looking for. \n\n**The Language Config**\nThe language config can be found at `/plugins/ProjectKorra/language.yml`. It contains all the messages ProjectKorra has, including the colors of all the elements, whether to use ProjectKorra formatting or not, the different prefixes for each element, etc.\n\n**Custom Abilities**\nCustom abilities go into the `/plugins/ProjectKorra/Abilities` folder. Then when you reload bending (`/b reload`) or restart your server, those abilities will be active.\nNote: Side Plugins do not go in this folder. Be sure to read the installation for ability packs on their resource page!"
