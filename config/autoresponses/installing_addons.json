These are generally singular abilities, but some addon packs are in this category, too.\n\nSide plugins can be downloaded on the forums as well, but side plugins MIST go into the `/plugins/` folder instead.\n\nIf you are unsure where to put the addon, read the installation guide on the resource page before installing. They will generally tell you where to put it.\n\nIf you are still having trouble, you can ask for help in the <#300990411353358336> channel about the specific addon you are using.",
