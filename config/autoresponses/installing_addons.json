These are generally singular abilities, but some addon packs are in this category, too.\n\nSide plugins can be downloaded on the forums as well, but side plugins MUST go into the `/plugins/` folder instead.\n\nIf you are unsure where to put the addon, read the title of it on the forums. If it says [Side Plugin] in the name, it's a side plugin.\n\nIf you are still having trouble, you can ask for help in the <#300990411353358336> channel about the specific addon you are using.",
